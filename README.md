# Rock Paper Scissors with Webcam

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors" using a webcam to capture the user's hand gestures. It utilizes machine learning to classify the hand gestures and determine the user's choice.

## Features

- **Webcam Integration**: Utilizes the webcam to capture real-time video input from the user.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Uses a pre-trained machine learning model to classify hand gestures captured by the webcam.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Provides an interactive gameplay experience where the user plays against the computer.
- **Visual Feedback**: Displays the user's hand gestures and the computer's choice visually on the screen.
- **Win Tracking**: Keeps track of the user's and computer's wins during the gameplay session.
- **Game Over Popup**: Displays a popup message when either the user or the computer reaches 5 wins, indicating the end of the game.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For the layout and styling of the user interface.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the game logic, webcam integration.
- **Python** : For machine learning classification.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model for image classification, provided by ml5.js.
- **Version Control**: Utilizes Git for version control and GitHub for hosting the project repository.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `home.html` file in a web browser that supports webcam access.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
